<h2><a href="https://github.com/chris-kesler/SNHU_CS-260_BinarySearchTree">Data Structure and Algorithms:  Binary Search Tree (C++) on GitHub</a></h2>

<p>
A series of algorithms that import data from a CSV file and store the entries in a binary search tree data structure.
</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
This project was created during my Bachelor's of Science (Computer Science) degree program at Southern New Hampshire University.  There are two main files involved, one of which is a CSV Parser that allows us to easily pull data from a CSV file (I did not develop this program, it was provided by my university), and the other is an algorithm that utilizes the CSV Parser to import the data into a binary search tree data structure.  The program includes a command prompt line that executes different functions based on user input, which include importing all the data in a sample CSV file, printing all the entries loaded in the data structure, searching the data structure for a specific entry based on a preset identifier, deleting a specific entry based on a preset identifier, deleting all the entries in the data structure, and exiting the program.  This program was developed by me throughout a course titled "Data Structures and Algorithms", which was a notably memorable course of mine.  I've given a fair bit of thought to the concept of binary search trees, their relationship to linked lists, and how to mathematically calculate their performance.

<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<h4>Dependencies</h4>
<ul>
<li>
Windows 10* || <a href='https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10'>Link to Download Windows</a>
</li>
<li>
Visual Studio 2019 || <a href='https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/'>Link to Download Visual Studio</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p><i>*potentially not required, but it is what I used and therefore know for certain works</i></p>

<h4>Installing</h4>
<ul>
<li>
Download the Project Files from the Project Repository on GitHub || <a href='https://github.com/chris-kesler/SNHU_CS-260_BinarySearchTree'>Link to Repository</a>
</li>
<li>
Cloning the Repository via Git is ideal, but downloading a zip and extracting it will also work || <a href='https://git-scm.com/downloads'>Link to Download Git</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h4>Executing Program</h4>
<ul>
<li>You can create a new project in Visual Studio using existing project files, create an empty project and move the project files into the new directory, manually, or create an empty project and clone directly to that folder using Git</li>
<li>Navigate to and open the BinarySearchTree.cpp file from within Visual Studio</li>
<li>Pressing f5 will compile and run the program, showing a command prompt window with an input menu</li>
<li>Follow the menu options by typing the number corresponding to the command you want to execute and pressing enter to load, print, find, delete, or exit the program
<ul>
<li>For example, press "9" followed by "Enter" to close the command prompt window</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Help</h3>
<p>
Most of the issues I ran into with this program involve creating the actual binary search tree, but I also had some issues with Visual Studio since I find it to be the least intuitive IDE I've used thus far.  This video helps go over Visual Studio basics and familiarity, which helped me a great deal.
